# hw3-Password_Genereator

I created a web based application that randomly generates a password that meets certain criteria and provides greater security.

This application presents a series of prompts:
Length, whether user wants special, numeric, lower case and/or upper case.
User gets prompt if the following criteria was not selected:
Length between 8 - 128 characters
If none of the character types prompts was selected.

If all the criteria is presented, the application generates a password which is displayed in the window's page.

This is the live application on the web

This is the repo where all the files and code are
